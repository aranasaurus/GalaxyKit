# GalaxyKit
A framework for generating galaxies algorithmically.

# Building the sample app
Xcode 7.2 is (probably) required.

1. Open [Galaxy Machine.xcodeproj](sample/Galaxy Machine.xcodeproj) from within the `sample` directory.
2. Make sure the `Galaxy Machine` (not `GalaxyKit`) target is selected then Build and Run
3. If you have any troubles, open an [issue](https://github.com/aranasaurus/GalaxyKit/issues) or come find me in the [ios-developers slack](https://ios-developers.io)!
