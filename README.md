# Getting it to build
Xcode 7.2 is (probably) required.

Currently in order to get the app to build you need to set your Derived Data folder to be workspace-relative. There is an open issue for me to fix this (#10), but until I do you'll have to change this setting yourself to make the app build (it's in File -> Workspace Settings).

Also note, the playground file doesn't currently work and I'm not sure that it will again without an Xcode update that fixes it.
